## About

The LAMB Interdisciplinary Research Framework (LIRF) is a structured mapping system designed to organize, connect, and deepen interdisciplinary research across theological, philosophical, metaphysical, mathematical, and physical domains.  
It uses a dual-axis system:
- **X-Axis:** Progression through tensional states (formation, tension, movement, stabilization, fulfillment, and new formation)
- **Y-Axis:** Focus on philosophical, metaphysical, mathematical, and physical inquiry

This repository contains:
- The baseline framework structure
- Summaries of foundational works
- Theological and interdisciplinary argument mappings
- Guidelines for contributing and referencing
